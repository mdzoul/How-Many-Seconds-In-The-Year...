``` python

days_this_year = int(input("How many days are in this year?"))

days_in_year = 365
days_in_leapyear = 366
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minute = 60


result = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute

leapyear_result = days_in_leapyear * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute


if days_this_year == 366:
  print("Number of seconds in a leap year are", leapyear_result)
else:
  print("Number of seconds in a year are", result)
